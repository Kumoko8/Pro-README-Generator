# Pro-README-Generator

# Description

This repository is for creating homework #9 for UT Bootcamp to make a README generator using Node. This project taught me about the basics of back-end development whose program is run solely in the command line. Node can read and create front end files from the command line and use inquirer to generate question prompts and more. We also learned about the npm (node package manager) which is needed for importing and installing programs and files for functionality. 

# How to Use
This project is used to make your very own README! Answer each prompt to input the information you want for your new project and this program will generate the README organized and structured for you!
