# Pro-README-Generator

# Description

This repository is for creating homework #9 for UT Bootcamp to make a README generator using Node. This project taught me about the basics of back-end development whose program is run solely in the command line. Node can read and create front-end files from the command line and use Inquirer to generate question prompts and more. We also learned about the npm (node package manager) which is needed for importing and installing programs and files for functionality. For the first time, I also created a file directly from the command line without having to use any HTML or CSS, which was intriguing.

# How to Use
This project is used to make your very own README! After accessing the file, open the command terminal and type "npm start" to initiate the program. Answer each prompt about the README of your project to input the information you want and this program will generate the README organized and structured for you! It automatically creates the section headings that correspond with each question and links them to the Table of Contents for ease of navigation and readability. The file is also able to be edited so you can add or remove whatever you would like!
