# OOP-Logo Maker

 
  ## Description

 
     This project's purpose is to showcase our knowledge of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) which is essentially a programming approach that treats everything as an object so that they can make code more modular and easier to manipulate and modify. We learned about inheritance and polymorphism and creating class and function objects.
